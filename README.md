# Video Rotator Tool

## Introduction
The reason I created this project is because there are not easy simple ways to rotate and save videos on Windows. The Video Rotator Tool is a Python-based application designed to easily rotate videos on Windows. It allows users to select a video file, choose a rotation angle, then save the rotated video either by overwriting the original or saving a new file in the same directory. This tool is ideal for quickly adjusting the orientation of videos without needing complex video editing software.

## Features
- Simple GUI for easy interaction.
- Supports rotating videos at 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.
- Option to overwrite the original video or save the rotated video as a new file.
- Moves original video to an "unrotated" folder if not overwriting in the same directory.
